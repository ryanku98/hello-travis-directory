# My Directory of Hello Travis Mini-Projects #

Hello all. This is literally just a directory for me to keep track of all the Hello Travis mini-projects I'm creating to help myself learn how to use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).

If you're interested in starting from the absolute basics (like I am), feel free to browse through the directory of what I hope will soon be a long list of basic examples. If not, please ignore (:
